## Overview
Ecogive is a waste management and donation platform that aims to promote sustainability by providing a convenient way for individuals and organizations to manage their waste and donate reusable items. The platform was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Currently the project is focused on the frontend implementation, but please note that the project is actively being developed, and I have plans to add the backend functionality soon. The backend implementation will introduce additional features and enhance the overall functionality of Ecogive. These features may include user authentication, database integration, donation tracking, and more.
